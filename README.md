# 100Devs-SuperReview

Hello and welcome to my Super Review Repo!

As part of the 100Devs program, Leon (founder of 100Devs) had a 9.5 hour Super Review on everything we learned in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So I decided to include it on my GitHub to showcase what I have learned in this program so far. 

As I go through the Super Review, I will comment and specify any *new* code that was written by me without assistance. 

Thanks for coming by!
